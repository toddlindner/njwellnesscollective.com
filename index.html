                Inspired to create meaningful pieces of jewelry that each carry an individual intention, a story, a purpose. I handcraft each piece with great intention of love and compassion. The vibrations and healing properties of these stones and metals combined with the loving Reiki energy is a way to provide healing energy as you wear them and it is my hope that it will bring you love, inner peace and happiness…From my heart to yours...OM Shanti

Looking for a truly unique gift? A Reiki session is something EVERYONE can use. Reiki is a form of deep relaxation and healing using a hands-on, gentle energy technique. Many cultures believe there is a life-force energy critical to our overall health and vitality. When this energy is allowed to flow freely, we are better able to relax, find balance, detoxify, and heal.  I would love the world to experience how much better they feel after a Reiki session. It's a great way to start off the New Year with clarity and renewal. Visit my website for special pricing for first-time clients and a holiday special for existing clients.
